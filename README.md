# About me
Hi, Iâ€™m @hetias. I'm currently a student, who's interested on game development and modding.

I still learning, and i have the basics, but not enough to create a project all by myself. 
So right now i'm looking to learn and collaborate on things that intereste me here. 

## code experience
So far most of my experience on code is with c++, but i have tasted most of the known languages (Java, C#, python, Javascript, etc). Most of it is more
theoretical than practical.

## interest
Primarly i'm interested in game programming (beyond just coding too), but web backend development (and networking in general) it's a actual interest too.
